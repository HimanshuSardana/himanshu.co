## stuff i use
- **OS**: Arch (btw) Linux  
- **Text Editor**: Neovim  
- **Terminal**: kitty (along with tmux)  
- some other useful utilities: fzf, rofi  

## Arch Linux
Memes aside, the reason I chose to go with Arch as my distro of choice was the fact that it's very bare bones and is a very DIY-style distro. I enjoy having full control over my environment, and Arch allows me to install only what I need without unnecessary bloat. The rolling release model also ensures I always have access to the latest software.

If you're comfortable with the command line and want to learn more about how Linux works under the hood, I highly recommend giving Arch a try.

## Neovim
I switched to Neovim after years of hopping between editors and IDEs. It hits the sweet spot between minimalism and power. Out of the box, it’s lightweight, but with Lua-based configuration and plugins, I’ve tailored it to fit exactly how I work.  

A few things I rely on:
- **telescope.nvim**: fuzzy finding for files, buffers, and git history.  
- **nvim-treesitter**: better syntax highlighting + parsing.  
- **lspconfig + cmp**: full language server support with autocompletion.  
- **harpoon**: quick navigation between project files.  

Once you invest in learning modal editing, it’s hard to go back. Every keystroke feels intentional, and I genuinely write code faster this way.  

## kitty + tmux
I use **kitty** as my terminal because it’s fast, GPU-accelerated, and has great font rendering. Paired with **tmux**, it becomes unstoppable. I can split panes, persist sessions, and jump between workspaces easily.  

I’ve got tmux keybindings tuned so I can switch panes and windows with just a few keystrokes. It feels like a tiling window manager inside my terminal.

## other utilities
Some honorable mentions:  
- **fzf**: makes searching through files and command history ridiculously quick.  
- **rofi**: my go-to launcher when I’m not inside tmux.  
- **ripgrep (rg)**: fast search through codebases.  
- **zoxide**: smarter `cd` replacement.  

These little tools don’t look flashy, but together they shave minutes off repetitive tasks. And that adds up.

This setup isn’t for everyone—it takes time to build and maintain—but that’s the point. It feels *mine*. Every part of it was chosen, not just given. And that’s why I think my Linux workflow is (superior).
